# Butterworth-Filters

The Butterworth filter is a type of signal processing filter designed to have a frequency response as flat as possible in the passband. It is also referred to as a maximally flat magnitude filter. The Butterworth filter is a type of signal processing filter expected to have zero roll off response in the stop-band.
Butterworth filters are one of the most commonly used digital filters in motion analysis and in audio circuits. They are fast and simple to use. Since they are frequency-based, the effect of filtering can be easily understood and predicted. 

# TYPES

There are two types of butterworth filters namely low pass butterworth filter and high pass butterworth filter.
