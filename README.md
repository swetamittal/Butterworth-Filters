# Butterworth-Filters

The Butterworth filter is a type of signal processing filter designed to have a frequency response as flat as possible in the passband. It is also referred to as a maximally flat magnitude filter. The Butterworth filter is a type of signal processing filter expected to have zero roll off response in the stop-band.
Butterworth filters are one of the most commonly used digital filters in motion analysis and in audio circuits. They are fast and simple to use. Since they are frequency-based, the effect of filtering can be easily understood and predicted. 
Choosing a cutoff frequency is easier than estimating the error involved in the raw data in the spline methods. However, one main disadvantage of the Butterworth filter is that it achieves this pass band flatness at the expense of a wide transition band as the filter changes from the pass band to the stop band.

# TYPES

There are two types of butterworth filters namely low pass butterworth filter and high pass butterworth filter.
